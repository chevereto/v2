Chevereto 2.6.0
=

Chevereto is an image hosting script that allows you to create a beautiful image hosting website in your own server. [Chevereto.com](http://chevereto.com)

###About this repo
This is the repository of Open Source Chevereto which has been pushed from Chevereto 2.X series. Chevereto 2.6.0 is the previous major version of Chevereto and that is what you will find here. **Current Chevereto series is 3.X** which is commercial but you can [get it free](http://chevereto.com/free) if you host with Arvixe or you can host elsewhere by purchasing a Chevereto license starting at $70 USD.

###Chevereto 2.X and 3.X
Both systems where crafted by the same person and they share the same *feel* but in code terms both systems are complete different and they keep few things (or almost nothing) in common. Chevereto 3 is the bold evolution of series 2.X but they don't share structure, patterns and conventions. Basically 3.X series was built in 2014 and series 2.X was built in 2011 so in computers is like comparing ages.

Chevereto 3.X comes with user accounts, galleries, responsive layout and more. You can find feature differences in the [Chevereto comparision table](http://chevereto.com/free). 

###Updates
Chevereto 2.6.0 actually is a very mature system and is the final release of Chevereto 2.X series. Updates will be only pushed only for security concerns and things like that.
